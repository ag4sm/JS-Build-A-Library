### Build a Library JavaScript demo
## Showcasing Class inheritance and syntax

This builds a library of media objects.  It uses a parent Media class then builds 

Further things to do with this project:  
*add more properties to each class (moviecast, song titles, etc)
*create a CD class that extends Media
*In .addRating, add a validator that makes sure ratings entered are between 1 and 5
*create a shuffle method for the CD class that returns a randomly sorted array of all the songs in the songs property
*create a Catalog class that holds all the media items
